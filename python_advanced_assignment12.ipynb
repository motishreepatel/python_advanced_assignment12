    "Yes, assigning a value to a string's indexed character violates Python's string immutability. In Python, strings are immutable, which means \n",

    "#Answer:\n",
    "In Python, there are multiple ways to index a character within a string. Here are the commonly used indexing techniques:\n",

    "second_last_character = my_string[-2]  # Access the second-to-last character\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Slicing: Slicing allows you to extract a range of characters from a string. It is denoted using the syntax [start:end:step]. The start index \n",

    "#Q- Q8. What is the benefit of first checking the target string with in or not in before using the index method to find a substring?\n",
    "#Answer:\n",
    "Checking the target string with the in or not in operator before using the index() method to find a substring offers several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Avoiding ValueError:\n",
    "The index() method raises a ValueError if the substring is not found within the target string. By using the in or not in operator first, you \n",
    "can avoid the exception and handle the case where the substring is not present. This prevents your program from abruptly terminating with \n",
    "an error.\n",

    "2. Improved Control Flow:\n",
    "Checking with in or not in allows you to have explicit control over the flow of your program based on the presence or absence of the substring. \n",

    "and control of your program.\n",

    "3. Efficiency:\n",
    "Checking with in or not in is generally more efficient than using the index() method, especially when you don't actually need the index \n",
    "position of the substring. The in or not in operator performs a simple membership test and stops as soon as it finds a match, whereas the \n",
    "index() method continues searching until it finds the first occurrence of the substring or reaches the end of the string. By avoiding the \n",
